    <h1>SFD04 Calculator</h1>
<!-- JOC: Set up the input boxes for the 1st and 2nd numbers that we will do some maths with.
Give them an id='xyz' so we can identify them later from the javascript (i.e. get their data, or update them)
-->
    FIRST NUMBER: <input type="text" id="fnum"><br>
    SECOND NUMBER: <input type="text" id="snum"><br>
    <!-- JOC: Now on the HTML page, make a select box with a few maths operator options (e.g. MUL for multiply).
    The actual option sent will be in the value="XYZ" statement e.g value="MUL".
    In that case, "MUL" will get sent to the onclick= function (f1() in this case) for identifying the
    right function to run on the data.
    So...when you click the selection dropdown, the browser page will call the function f1 (with no arguments)
    but it WILL see what you selected in the option e.g. MUL because it's going to do a .getElementById method
    on it AND the browser rendered this page before the javascript runs (ie. the code will know about the id's)
-->
<!-- JOC: When the user clicks, run the function f1() which will pick up the page values, and do a calculation.-->
    CHOOSE OPERATION: <select id="operation" onclick="f1()">
        <option value="MUL">MUL</option>
        <option value="SUB">SUB</option>
        <option value="ADD">ADD</option>
        <option value="MOD">MOD</option>
    </select><br>
    <!-- JOC: The id='result' identifies what the javascript will later update with the .getElemendById method
    That's why you need an id=xxx - so you can communicate back to the HTML and know where to put the result
-->
    RESULT <input type="text" id="result">

    <!-- JOC: Now for the script - note this code must appear AFTER the id= tags have been rendered by the
        browser. If you put this javascript BEFORE the HTML is rendered (e.g in the head section of page),
    it won't know how to find the id's, and will just keep displaying the page without any
    calculations from f1().

    This is THE important reason for keeping any Javascript that operates on the HTML page below the page HTML!
    The browser needs to set up the HTML with its id="xxx" before you can update any HTML tags via javascript.
-->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        // Now we are in javascript, comments are an // not a <!-- comment --> (they are for HTML only)

        // Define a function called f1 that takes no parameters, as it's going to update the HTML directly
        // via getElementByID. Just using the standard function definition syntax, not the other two more
        // complex ones we saw today (assign a variable to a function, or use an indirect =>. 
        // They have their uses but not important yet.
        function f1() {
            // First we get the tag elements for the two numbers from the HTML page above
            // Remember - they MUST be above (and rendered by the browser already),
            // or we won't know about them here! It's OK, this code is below their rendering, so this script
            // will find them fine.

                // just default to thinking of them as text (so + will just concatenate a string, 
                // not what we want.)

            // element with the id='result' with the result from the calculation.
            // We did this by setting the .value to a new calculated value.
